Prior to the Heroku deployment:
Upload your project to Github.

    Create a new repository in Github.
    Go to your project on your local machine.
    Open a gitbash from your working folder/project.
    Initialize the local directory as a Git repository ($ git init)
    Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit ($ git add .)
    Commit the files that you’ve staged in your local repository. ($ git commit -m "First commit")
    At the top of your GitHub repository’s Quick Setup page, click to copy the remote repository URL.
    Set remote repository from gitbash ($ git remote add origin remote_repository_URL)
    Verify remote repository ($ git remote -v)
    Push changes in your local repository to your remote repository ($ git push origin master)
